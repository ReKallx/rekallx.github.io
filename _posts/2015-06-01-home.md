## Life Security Platform

#### ReKall allows users to store information that is delivered to pre-selected "managers" in the event of a sudden personal emergency. Rather than leaving loved ones and co-workers scrambling in your absence, ReKall allows you to confidently address your immediate needs and private wishes in a safe, sensible manner so actions can be taken until your health is restored. ReKall is neither a will nor a living will, and it is not intended as a replacement for these important legal tools. Instead, it is a way for you to securely communicate your most urgent requests to the people whom you trust most.

#### Life is full of uncertainty. Make certain that yours is secure when you need it most.
